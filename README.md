# Telegram Xian Web dApp

Example of a Xian Web dApp for Telegram.

## Quick setup

#### 0. Host the Web App in GitHub Pages

The Web App must be hosted somewhere. Hosting it on a GitHub repository is a quick, free way to do it:

1. Create a repository (or fork this one)
2. On the repository: Settings > Pages:
    - Source: Deploy from a branch
    - Branch: master, / (root), Save
3. Wait a few minutes for the web to be deployed. It will be available at: `https://{github-username}.github.io/{repository-name}/{location-inside-repository}`.

#### Show the user a button to open a Web App. There are two ways:

1. Go to [Bot Father](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Select your bot
3. `Bot Settings` — `Menu Button` — `Specify..`/`Edit menu button URL`
4. Send a URL to your Web App
